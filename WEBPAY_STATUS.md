# WebPay Integration Status

## Current Status: DISABLED (Simulation Mode)

The WebPay integration is temporarily disabled because:
1. API endpoints need to be tested in production environment
2. Commerce codes and API keys need to be configured
3. Return URLs need to be properly set up

## To Enable WebPay:

1. Uncomment the WebPay code in EbookDetail.tsx
2. Comment out the simulation code
3. Configure environment variables:
   - WEBPAY_COMMERCE_CODE
   - WEBPAY_API_KEY
4. Test the /api/create-payment endpoint

## Current Behavior:
- Simulates successful purchase
- Creates purchase record in database
- Redirects to ebook reader
- Maintains all UX flow
